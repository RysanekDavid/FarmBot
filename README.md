Functionality of this project is to automate farming of stones in game Metin2. This bot does not use code injection but relies on image processing algorithms, so its not dependent on any libraries used by game client.

How does it work:
Metin stones are objects that spawn at random places throughout the world. They have certain amount of hit points which needs to be decreased to 0 for stone to be destroyed.
